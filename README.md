# Tic Tac Toe
Basic implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe with the pygame library.

Visit https://www.pygame.org/ for a documentation of pygame.

## Rules
Each player has one symbol, an 'X' or an 'O'. Every turn you set your symbol into one of the given fields. When the complete field is full and nobody won, the game ends draw.

You win, if you filled...
- a diagonal with the same symbol
- one row with the same symbol
- one column with the same symbol


## Still missing...
I will try to update this project and implement as many features as possible, to learn the fundamentals of pygame and Python. 

Things that are already on my list:
- show a score for both players :heavy_check_mark:
- reset match when it ends in a draw
- reset match and score through an option of the menu bar
